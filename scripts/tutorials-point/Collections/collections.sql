/*

    A collection is an ordered group of elements having the same data type. Each element
    is identified by a unique subscript that represents its position in the collection.

    PL/SQL provides three collection types:
        Index-by tables or Associative array
        Nested table
        Variable-size array or Varray

    Collection Information:

        --Format:
        Collection Type
            Number of Elements
            Subscript Type
            Dense or Sparse	Where Created
            Can Be Object Type Attribute

        Associative array (or index-by table)
            Unbounded
            String or integer
            Either
            Only in PL/SQL block
            No

        Nested table
            Unbounded
            Integer
            Starts dense, can become sparse
            Either in PL/SQL block or at schema level
            Yes

        Variablesize array (Varray)
            Bounded
            Integer
            Always dense
            Either in PL/SQL block or at schema level
            Yes

    Index-By Table
        An index-by table (also called an associative array) is a set of key-value pairs.
        Each key is unique and is used to locate the corresponding value. The key can be
        either an integer or a string.

        An index-by table is created using the following syntax. Here, we are creating an
        index-by table named table_name, the keys of which will be of the subscript_type
        and associated values will be of the element_type

    -- Example One: Index-By Table

    The following code for Index-By Table will printout:
    Salary of James is 78000
    Salary of Martin is 100000
    Salary of Minakshi is 75000
    Salary of Rajnish is 62000

    -- Example Two: Nested Tables

        A nested table is like a one-dimensional array with an arbitrary number of elements. However,
        a nested table differs from an array in the following aspects âˆ’

        An array has a declared number of elements, but a nested table does not. The size of a nested
        table can increase dynamically.

        An array is always dense, i.e., it always has consecutive subscripts. A nested array is dense
        initially, but it can become sparse when elements are deleted from it.

    The following code Nested Tables will printout:
    Total 5 Students
    Student:Kavita, Marks:98
    Student:Pritam, Marks:97
    Student:Ayan, Marks:78
    Student:Rishav, Marks:87
    Student:Aziz, Marks:92
